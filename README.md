## Purpose of This Project
As a Full Stack Web Developer I want to create a website that will hold a collection of learning videos geared towards toddler learning, in response to COVID-19. Parents are home but at work and the same goes for grade school children. The purpose of this project is to create a learning portal for toddlers

As a Parent with a toddler and grade school distance learning children due to COVID19 I am in need of a solution to my toddler spending countless hours watching uninformative content on youtube.
So that my toddler can continue their education as daycare did not provide chromebooks or zoom classes.
